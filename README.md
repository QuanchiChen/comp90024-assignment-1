# COMP90024 Assignment 1

In 2023 Semester 1 COMP90024 Cluster and Cloud Computing Assignment 1, we employed Python and [Message Passing Interface (MPI) programming](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to analyse large JSON files on [SPARTAN](https://dashboard.hpc.unimelb.edu.au/), the University of Melbourne High-Performance Computing (HPC) system.

## Team Overview

The team consists of two students at the School of Computing and Information Systems from the University of Melbourne.

- [Quanchi Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/quanchi-chen/) majoring in Master of Software Engineering
- [Benjamin Lo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-lo-6b7908258/) majoring in Master of Data Science

## Repository Structure

Assignment-Specification.pdf is the assignment specification. Please read it first.

Assignment-SPARTAN-Instructions.pdf includes instructions necessary to submit jobs to SPARTAN.

Assignment-Report.pdf is the final submitted report.

The directory `src` contains the source file of the analytics program named main.py. To run the program on your local machine, please install mpi4py via pip. Another script plot.py produced the plots included in the report.

The directory `slurm` contains the three SLURM scripts submitted to SPARTAN.

The directory `results` contains the three output files generated by SPARTAN.

The directory `feedback` contains the received written feedback for Assignment 1 and Assignment 2.
